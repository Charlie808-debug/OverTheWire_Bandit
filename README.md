# OverTheWire Bandit — Linux & Cybersecurity Writeups

This repository documents my complete journey solving all levels (0–34) of the **OverTheWire Bandit** wargame.  
Bandit is a widely-recognized cybersecurity challenge that builds foundational skills in Linux, scripting, enumeration, and problem solving.

Each level file includes:
- Command steps with reasoning
- Objective descriptions
- Key takeaways to reinforce learning
- Reproducible solutions

## 📂 Repository Structure

| Level Range | Writeup |
|------------|----------|
| 0–5 | `Level 0-5.md` |
| 6–10 | `Level 6-10.md` |
| 11–15 | `Level 11-15.md` |
| 16–20 | `Level 15-20.md` |
| 21–25 | `Level 21-25.md` |
| 26–30 | `Level 26-30.md` |
| 31–34 | `Level 31-34.md` |

## 🛠 Skills Demonstrated

- Command-line fluency (bash/Linux)
- Service enumeration & automation (grep/sort/find)
- Decoding and encoding formats (base64, ROT13)
- Shell escape techniques & restricted shell bypass
- Git forensics (history, branches, tags)
- Network interaction (`ncat`, `openssl`, etc.)
- Privilege context analysis

## 📖 What I Learned

This project helped me internalize:
- Linux filesystem & shell command mastery
- Pattern recognition and problem decomposition
- System enumeration and automation
- Safe handling of encoded and compressed data
- Version control diagnostics (Git insights)
- Understanding cron, privileges, and restricted environments
---

## 🚀 Purpose

This repository is structured to:
- Demonstrate my hands-on learning and technical reasoning
- Serve as a reference for future labs and security projects
- Provide a foundation for entry-level security roles and internships
